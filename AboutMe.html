    <h2>Hi, I’m Edijs.</h2>
    
      <p>Studying web development at Riga Coding School. Currently based in Riga, Latvia. <br></p>

      <p>For the last eight years, I have been a chef. When I was younger, I used to love two things – cooking and IT. 
        Culinary arts was the major I took in high school, and since finishing that, I have been traveling around the globe, working for some of the best restaurants in the world.
         But, after spending so many years abroad, I came to the conclusion, that I have reached my limits as a chef, and wanted to change my career path.<br></p>

      <p>Since my second biggest interest was technologies – why not start there! I have always been passionate about the tech industry – interested in what other internet content creators were doing, as well as coming up with my own stuff. 
        Since game design and development have been following me throughout my life wherever I go, I’ve tried my luck in developing apps as well.
         Previously I have worked with Unity Engine, but only as an enthusiast. It brings me joy knowing that I can create a playable virtual world! 
         That is one of the reasons why I signed up for Riga Coding School – to become a developer.  <br></p>

      <p>I am good at time management, love to work in a team, as well as individually, and I have a high sense of responsibility. <br></p>

      <p>In the future, I plan to work in the IT industry as a developer because I truly enjoy it. 
        Every day I try to learn more than I did the day before. 
        I strive to achieve the best results possible in everything I do. 
        <br></p>
        <p>Being able to create something from scratch, and building skills is what keeps me going!</p>
